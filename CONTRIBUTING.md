## Style Guidelines

### JavaScript Style

- Use ES6+ features where appropriate
- Follow consistent indentation (2 spaces)
- Use meaningful variable and function names
- Add comments for complex logic
- Keep functions small and focused

```javascript
// Good
async function fetchUserSummary(userId) {
  try {
    const response = await api.getSummary(userId);
    return response.data;
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Failed to fetch summary:', error);
    throw error;
  }
}

// Avoid
async function f(id) {
  return await api.getSummary(id).data;
}
```

### CSS Style

- Use semantic class names
- Group related properties
- Use CSS variables for theming
- Mobile-first approach when applicable

### Commit Messages

- Use present tense ("Add feature" not "Added feature")
- Use imperative mood ("Move cursor to..." not "Moves cursor to...")
- Limit first line to 72 characters
- Reference issues and pull requests when applicable

Example:
```
Add summary export functionality

- Implement PDF export option
- Add Markdown export format
- Update UI with export button

Fixes #123
```
